<p><h2><i>Check your password - does it meet ISI policy?</i></h2>

It is highly recommended that you have a strong password - one that is secure and cannot be easily decrypted.<p>

<p>To test the strength of your passwords, type a password into the box below.<p>

<h2><span class="password">Password complexity test:</span></h2>

 <div id="content" class="top-level section">
	<p style="margin-bottom:1em;">For security reasons Javascript is required for this website to work.</p>
	<h2>Why?</h2>
	<p>Because Javascript runs on your computer.</p>
	<p>Which means no information is transferred over the internet when you type in your password.</p>
	<p>Which means that no one can intercept it.</p>
</div>

<p>Note - your password is not stored anywhere, not even on the server. This form uses client-side JavaScript to perform the test so no information is transmit across the network. The estimated time provided is based on a single PC trying to guess your password. The use of multiple PCs would reduce the time required.</p>
