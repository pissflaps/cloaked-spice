Hi team,
<Br>
After working with a couple of Becky's customers at Accenture, we have updated their buffer boxes to push to the EFT server at Berbee. However, the data sources have not been moved from our Schaumburg servers yet, so we will need to routinely move the CDR from BWS1i to CB1 in order to collect the data and keep the system in production.
<Br>
The accounts listed below will detail where the data is currently being pushed to from the customer, and where it will need to be moved to in order for Infortel Select to collect it. <br>
<ul>
<li>\\bws1i\cdr\calgary\ANC5ABXI1.000</li>
Should move to
<ul><li>\\s1wstest\Accenture\</li></ul>
<br>
<li>\\bws1i\cdr\cermak\AN77</li>
Should move to
<ul><li>\\cb1\Accenture\</li></ul>
</ul>
<br>
Please consult with Jim Mulhern for any questions or concerns.
